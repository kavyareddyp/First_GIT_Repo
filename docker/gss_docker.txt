Docker Introduction
------------------------
- Docker is a software which provides centralized platform to execute your application
- It wraps software components into a complete standardized unit which contains everything require to run
- Docker is a container management service.
- The keywords of Docker are Build, ship  and run anywhere. 
- The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.




------------------------------
Docker Installation on Ubuntu
-----------------------------

- First, add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to the system:
          curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
- Add the Docker repository to APT sources:
         sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" 
- Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:
	sudo apt-get update 
- Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu 16.04 repo:
	sudo apt-cache policy docker-ce
	
- Finally, install Docker:
	sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
- Docker should now be installed, Check that it's running:
	sudo systemctl status docker
- checking the docker version:
      	docker --version
- Add your username to the docker group to avoid typing sudo whenever you run the docker command
	sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
- You can log out of the server and log-in back to apply changes
- Check whether your user added to docker group or not


Working with Docker
----------------------

- To familiar with the docker commands, then try below commands first
	docker
	docker  - -version
	docker info

- To view the switches available to a specific command, type:
	docker docker-subcommand –help
- To check whether you can access and download images from Docker Hub, type:
                docker run hello-world        
           The output, should indicate that  Docker in working correctly
- You can search for images available on Docker Hub by  using below command:
               docker search ubuntu

Creating a account on DockerHub:
--------------------------------
- Docker Hub is a registry service on the cloud that allows you to download Docker images that are built by other communities. 
- You can also upload your own Docker built images to Docker hub.
- The official site for Docker hub is : 
	https://hub.docker.com/
- First you need to do a simple sign-up on Docker hub.
- Once you have signed up, you will be logged into Docker Hub
- Next, let’s browse and find the Jenkins image.

Pulling and Running an Image from DockerHub
-------------------------------------------

- If you scroll down on the same page, you can see the Docker pull command. This
- will be used to download the Jenkins image onto the local Ubuntu serve
	docker pull jenkins
- To run Jenkins, you need to run the following command:
 	docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins

- You will then have Jenkins successfully running as a container on the Ubuntu machine.

Docker commands:
You can always push a new image to this repository using the CLI
$ docker tag local-image:tagname new-repo:tagname
$ docker push new-repo:tagname

You can always push a new image to this repository.
docker push ashok9dockhub/gssInfotech:tagname 


go to docker hub link: https://hub.docker.com and search for Jenkins

and get the pull command from that screen
run below command on your CLI

explanation::::
-----------------------
This docker-compose.yml file tells Docker to do the following:

Pull the image from the registry.

Run 3 instances of that image as a service called web, limiting each one to use, at most, 10% 
of a single core of CPU time (this could also be e.g. “1.5” to mean 1 and half core for each), 
and 50MB of RAM.

Immediately restart containers if one fails.

Map port 4000 on the host to web’s port 80.

Instruct web’s containers to share port 80 via a load-balanced network called webnet. 
(Internally, the containers themselves publish to web’s port 80 at an ephemeral port.)

Define the webnet network with the default settings (which is a load-balanced overlay network).


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
in short:::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

FROM

Usage:

FROM <image>
FROM <image>:<tag>
FROM <image>@<digest>
Information:

FROM must be the first non-comment instruction in the Dockerfile.
FROM can appear multiple times within a single Dockerfile in order to create multiple images. 
Simply make a note of the last image ID output by the commit before each new FROM command.
The tag or digest values are optional. If you omit either of them, the builder assumes a latest 
by default. The builder returns an error if it cannot match the tag value.
_

MAINTAINER

Usage:

MAINTAINER <name>
The MAINTAINER instruction allows you to set the Author field of the generated images.

Reference

RUN

Usage:

RUN <command> (shell form, the command is run in a shell, which by default is /bin/sh -c on 
Linux or cmd /S /C on Windows)
RUN ["<executable>", "<param1>", "<param2>"] (exec form)
Information:

The exec form makes it possible to avoid shell string munging, and to RUN commands using a base 
image that does not contain the specified shell executable.
The default shell for the shell form can be changed using the SHELL command.
Normal shell processing does not occur when using the exec form. For example, RUN ["echo", 
"$HOME"] will not do variable substitution on $HOME.
_

CMD

Usage:

CMD ["<executable>","<param1>","<param2>"] (exec form, this is the preferred form)
CMD ["<param1>","<param2>"] (as default parameters to ENTRYPOINT)
CMD <command> <param1> <param2> (shell form)
Information:

The main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container. These defaults can 
include an executable, or they can omit the executable, in which case you must specify an 
ENTRYPOINT instruction as well.
There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile. If you list more than one CMD then only 
the last CMD will take effect.
If CMD is used to provide default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT instruction, both the CMD and 
ENTRYPOINT instructions should be specified with the JSON array format.
If the user specifies arguments to docker run then they will override the default specified in 
CMD.
Normal shell processing does not occur when using the exec form. For example, CMD ["echo", 
"$HOME"] will not do variable substitution on $HOME.
_

LABEL

Usage:

LABEL <key>=<value> [<key>=<value> ...]
Information:

The LABEL instruction adds metadata to an image.
To include spaces within a LABEL value, use quotes and backslashes as you would in command-line 
parsing.
Labels are additive including LABELs in FROM images.
If Docker encounters a label/key that already exists, the new value overrides any previous 
labels with identical keys.
To view an image’s labels, use the docker inspect command. They will be under the "Labels" JSON 
attribute.
_

EXPOSE

Usage:

EXPOSE <port> [<port> ...]
Information:

Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network port(s) at runtime.
EXPOSE does not make the ports of the container accessible to the host.
_

ENV

Usage:

ENV <key> <value>
ENV <key>=<value> [<key>=<value> ...]
Information:

The ENV instruction sets the environment variable <key> to the value <value>.
The value will be in the environment of all “descendant” Dockerfile commands and can be 
replaced inline as well.
The environment variables set using ENV will persist when a container is run from the resulting 
image.
The first form will set a single variable to a value with the entire string after the first 
space being treated as the <value> - including characters such as spaces and quotes.
_

ADD

Usage:

ADD <src> [<src> ...] <dest>
ADD ["<src>", ... "<dest>"] (this form is required for paths containing whitespace)
Information:

Copies new files, directories, or remote file URLs from <src> and adds them to the filesystem 
of the image at the path <dest>.
<src> may contain wildcards and matching will be done using Go’s filepath.Match rules.
If <src> is a file or directory, then they must be relative to the source directory that is 
being built (the context of the build).
<dest> is an absolute path, or a path relative to WORKDIR.
If <dest> doesn’t exist, it is created along with all missing directories in its path.
_

COPY

Usage:

COPY <src> [<src> ...] <dest>
COPY ["<src>", ... "<dest>"] (this form is required for paths containing whitespace)
Information:

Copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the 
path <dest>.
<src> may contain wildcards and matching will be done using Go’s filepath.Match rules.
<src> must be relative to the source directory that is being built (the context of the build).
<dest> is an absolute path, or a path relative to WORKDIR.
If <dest> doesn’t exist, it is created along with all missing directories in its path.
_

ENTRYPOINT

Usage:

ENTRYPOINT ["<executable>", "<param1>", "<param2>"] (exec form, preferred)
ENTRYPOINT <command> <param1> <param2> (shell form)
Information:

Allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable.
Command line arguments to docker run <image> will be appended after all elements in an exec 
form ENTRYPOINT and will override all elements specified using CMD.
The shell form prevents any CMD or run command line arguments from being used, but the 
ENTRYPOINT will start via the shell. This means the executable will not be PID 1 nor will it 
receive UNIX signals. Prepend exec to get around this drawback.
Only the last ENTRYPOINT instruction in the Dockerfile will have an effect.
_

VOLUME

Usage:

VOLUME ["<path>", ...]
VOLUME <path> [<path> ...]
Creates a mount point with the specified name and marks it as holding externally mounted 
volumes from native host or other containers.

_

USER

Usage:

USER <username | UID>
The USER instruction sets the user name or UID to use when running the image and for any RUN, 
CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.



WORKDIR

Usage:

WORKDIR </path/to/workdir>
Information:

Sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow 
it.
It can be used multiple times in the one Dockerfile. If a relative path is provided, it will be 
relative to the path of the previous WORKDIR instruction.
_

ARG

Usage:

ARG <name>[=<default value>]
Information:

Defines a variable that users can pass at build-time to the builder with the docker build 
command using the --build-arg <varname>=<value> flag.
Multiple variables may be defined by specifying ARG multiple times.
It is not recommended to use build-time variables for passing secrets like github keys, user 
credentials, etc. Build-time variable values are visible to any user of the image with the 
docker history command.
Environment variables defined using the ENV instruction always override an ARG instruction of 
the same name.
Docker has a set of predefined ARG variables that you can use without a corresponding ARG 
instruction in the Dockerfile.
HTTP_PROXY and http_proxy
HTTPS_PROXY and https_proxy
FTP_PROXY and ftp_proxy
NO_PROXY and no_proxy
